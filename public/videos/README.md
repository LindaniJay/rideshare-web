This folder is optional.

The site’s hero video uses the file:
- public/hero-video.mp4  (served at /hero-video.mp4)

To swap the hero background video, replace that file.

If you prefer keeping videos organized under public/videos/, you can do that too,
but you’ll need to update the source paths in the hero components accordingly.
